2005-05-20  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Client.cc (giveInputFocus): 
	Removed WM_TAKE_FOCUS sending from Client::giveInputFocus. It's not
	beeing handled correctly thus disrupting focus. ICCCM and EWMH
	compliance should be reworked and verified in the future.

2005-05-19  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/WindowManager.cc (sigHandler): 
	Changed WindowManager::reload to set a reload flag that will be
	handled from the main loop to get rid of evil race conditions.
	This isn't perfect yet as it needs a better main event loop,
	currently reload will wait until an event reaches the queue.

	* src/PMenu.cc (selectItem): 
	Fixed BadDrawable error doing XCopyArea to non-mapped window.

	* src/WindowManager.cc (handleFocusOutEvent):

	* src/PImage.hh: 
	New Image handling code with native backend supporting loading of
	JPG (libjpeg), PNG (libpng) and XPM (libXpm) or using Imlib2 as
	backend supporting its image formats. Now, pekwm also can be compiled
	without any Image support at all thus removing the libXpm dependency.
	
	This code is experimental and incomplete, there is no support for
	shaping and Imlib2 backend is still incomplete. Expect updates soon.

2005-05-15  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/DockApp.cc (readClassHint): 
	DockApp::readClassHint were using effective (which can be the iconic)
	dock app window when searching for the hint but should instead use
	the client window. Fixing issues with harbour sorting.

	* src/PDecor.cc (activateChild): 
	Removed restackBorder from PDecor::activateChild and now raising
	active child if any after restacking border. Closing #30

2005-05-14  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Workspaces.cc (getTopWO): 
	Now more carefull validation of what PWinObj to focus when changing
	workspace including fallback to root window if focusing fails.
	
	Added check for focusability in Workspaces::getTopWO so only
	mapped anf focusable PWinObjs are returned.

2005-05-11  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
	
	* src/Theme.cc (load): 
	Improved theme validation, now pekwm manages to start with empty or
	nonexistent theme file. Closing #9
	( Thanks Jan Matejek <matejcik{@}gmail{.}com> for reporting )

	* src/PDecor.cc (applyBorderShape): 
	Changed shaped window behaviour, now shaped windows will appear to
	be borderless even if they didn't request so however titlebar is
	kept. This is basically the behaviour of TWM. Closing #3
	( Thanks Jyri Jokinen <shared{@}adresh{.}com> for reporting )
	
	* src/PDecor.cc (getBorderSize): 
	Added size validation in getBorderSize to fix issues with unsigned
	value wrap.

2005-05-09  Jyri Jokinen  <shared{@}adresh{.}com>

	* data/keys:
	Fixed two typos, one that caused half the file not to be parsed
	and made it impossible to menu navigate or MoveResize with keys.
	( Thanks agnitio and David Frey <dpfrey{@}shaw{.}ca> for reporting )

2005-05-09  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/CmdDialog.cc (exec): 
	Altered CmdDialog::exec behaviour, now when entering commands in
	the CmdDialog and it doesn't matches a valid Action we now assume
	it's an Exec action.

	* src/WindowManager.cc (handleFocusInEvent): 
	Now flushing Enter and Leave events when found an usable FocusIn
	event to stop them from interfering with the focus policy.
	Closing #1

	NOTE: This might have focusing side effects, please report if
	      experiencing any weird focus behaviour.

	( Thanks Jyri Jokinen <shared{@}adresh{.}com> for reporting )

	* src/PDecor.cc (Button): 
	Removed CWEventMask from PDecor::Button windows so that we can
	distinguish wheter or not the pointer were on the button on

	multiple tasks (like unsetting border and titlebar decor) at the
	same time to minimize the number of ConfigureRequest events beeing
	sent.

	* src/PDecor.cc (PDecor): 
	Resource usage fixes. Add missing returnPixmap for the title
	background on PDecors.

2005-05-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Client.cc (Client): 
	Modified the behaviour of ApplyOn Start autogrouping, now groups
	are preserved when doing restart in such a sense previously pekwm
	managed windows will remain in their groups. New clients however
	will be added to the groups if suitable. Closing #17
	( Thanks Anders Engstrom <ankan{@}nianze{.}com for request )

	* src/PDecor.cc (setTitlebar): 
	Updated PDecor::setTitlebar, PDecor::setBorder and PDecor::resize to
	make it safe from disappearing as shading a non full width title
	removes border etc. Closing #23 and #24
	( Thanks Jyri Jokinen <shared{@}adresh{.}com> for reporting )

2005-05-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	fixing some small errors.
	( Thanks Rob McDonald <frobnoid{@}gmail{.}com> for patch )
	
	* src/PDecor.cc (resize): 
	Now PDecor::resize doesn't unshade if shaded, just updates the
	real_height property so that it will unshade to the correct size.
	This fixes two known, and probably some unknown issues where
	decors have been unshaded unwillingly.

	* src/CfgParser.cc (parseCComment): 
	Fixed infinte loop when garbage / (with no / or * following) were
	found in configuration files.

2005-05-02  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	Added vars file to default set of config files.

	* src/CfgParser.cc (load): 
	Now, the INCLUDE directive will first try the current working
	directory / absoulte path (old behaviour) and if that fails it
	will try to include the file relative from the directory the
	current file resides.

	Fixed broken testcase in Parser::safeSubstr.
	
	* src/CmdDialog.cc (handleKeyPress):
	Added two new actions for CmdDialog. CursBegin and CursEnd. Names
	beeing self explanatory.
	
	* src/CmdDialog.cc (bufChanged): 
	Updated CmdDialog behaviour. HistNext and HistPrev actions now move

	more naturally and a position at 0 bug was fixed.
	
	* src/PDecor.cc (PDecor): 
	Added missing initializer of PDecor member _button. Fixing segfault
	caused by using _button pointing on undefined. Closing #22
	( Thanks Jyri Jokinen <shared{@}adresh{.}com> for reporting )

	* src/PDecor.cc (renderTitle): 
	Initial work of having PWM like titlebars with the border below the
	titles. This introduces three new theme options:

	  * WidthMax, maximum width of titles in percent relative to width.
	              This value overides WidthMin if it's smaller.
	  * WidthSymetric, symetric "tab" width.

	To make the title use the old and default style of handling the title
	set WidthMin to 0.

	* src/Workspaces.cc:
	Applied one line patch from Walter Mundt <emage{@}spamcop{.}net>
	closing #46. Walter Mundt's comment on the bug:

	"I think the problem is that when Workspaces gives input focus to
	the last-focused window in the new workspace, it forgets to tell
	the WindowObject class that it has done so.  When the unmap events
	come through, WindowObject says there's no focused object, so
	WindowManager picks a new one -- the sticky window.  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
	This patch fixes things."

2004-01-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/ActionHandler.cc (handleStateAction): 
	Replaced ToggleGrouping action with a new Set,Unset,Toggle state
	named GlobalGrouping.

	* src/Frame.cc (giveInputFocus): 
	Added check to make sure the Frame is inside the viewport before
	giving it input focus.

	* src/WindowManager.cc (findGroup): 
	Corrected the meaning of Global, previously it only skipped the check
	if the window was mapped but it didn't skip the test if the window
	was inside the viewport.

	Made a group size 0 mean unlimited size.

	* src/BaseMenu.cc (selectNextItem, selectPrevItem): 
	Made selectNextItem and selectPrevItem not deselecting item if there's
	only one valid item in the list. Closes #40

	Fixed compile warning.
	( Thanks Alaa Abd El Fatah <alaa{@}linux-egypt{.}org> for noting )

	possible to do INCLUDE = "variables" and use the variables
	in variables in the file where the INCLUDE was issued.

	* src/PFont.cc (trimMiddle): 
	Tweaked the trimMiddle so that max_width shouldn't be overriden.

	* src/BaseMenu.cc (selectNextItem,selectPrevItem): 
	Fixed menu navigation with keyboard, before it had issues with
	dynamic menus ( stopping at the entries which are not visible ).

	* src/*:
	Three new actions has been introduced Set, Unset and Toggle.
	These actions are used to manipulate toggable properties of
	Frames and has been introduced instead of introducing actions
	like SetMaximized and UnsetShaded. Valid states are:
	
	  Maximized bool bool, Fullscreen, Shaded, Sticky, AlwaysOntop,
	  AlwaysBelow, DecorBorder, DecorTitlebar, Iconified,
	  Tagged bool, Marked, Skip mask

	This change makes the following actions invalid:

	  Maximize, Fullscreen, Shade, Stick, AlwaysOnTop,
	  AlwaysBelow, ToggleBorder, ToggleTitleBar, ToggleDecor,
	  Iconify, ToggleTag, ToggleTagBehind, MarkClient, ToggleSkip.

	Sorry for the inconvience, happy config file hacking. ;)

	file instead of ~/.pekwm/config and SYSCONFDIR/config.
	( Thanks "alot of persons" for request )

2003-12-01  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (maximize): 
	Now checking if the frame is mapped instead of it's on the same
	workspace so that it takes sticky windows in account and doesn't take
	hidden windows in account. Closes #35
	( Thanks Aristotle Pagaltzis <pagaltzis{@}gmx{.}de> for reporting )

2003-11-27  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/ActionHandler.cc (handleAction):

	Resist. To get the old Snap behaviour one sets both Attract and
	Resist to the same value.
	( Thanks Per von Zweigbergk <pvz{@}e dot kth{.}se >
	
	* src/Frame.cc (calcSizeInCells): 
	Fixed bug caused invalid reporting of size in cells ( 80x24 etc ).

	Now one can execute global key-bindings while navigating the menu,
	however, menu-bindings match before global-bindings.

	* src/WindowManager.cc (handleKeyEvent), src/Frame.cc (doMove):
	Made handleKeyEvent a public method so that it can be used in
	Frame::doMove so one can execute key-bindings when moving frames.
	( Thanks Za Ny for request )

	* src/Config.cc: 
	Made all actions valid for RootClick also valid for the ScreenEdge.

2003-11-17  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/*:
	Added two new actions, WarpFrameToWorkspace and WarpFrameToViewport
	valid in the ScreenEdge section of the mouse file. These are intended
	for use together with EnterMovingFrame to make workspace/viewport
	switching possible while moving frames. The actions take the standard
	GotoWorkspace and ViewportGoto parameter.

2003-11-16  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (doMove): 
	Added support for EnterMovingFrame actions, no actions are currently
	supported though but.

	* src/Client.cc (mapWindow,unmapWindow), src/Frame.cc (applyState): 
	Now unmapping the client window and not only the parent window
	when unmapping. Required syncing of the mapped state in
	Frame::applyState to work correctly when attaching clients from
	non-active workspaces. Partially closes #29

2003-11-11  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/WindowManager.cc (handleXError): 
	Yet another pekwm crash on restart fixed. XCloseDisplay issues
	XSync and if any errors exists the X11 error handler is called which
	was using the PScreen::instance, it has been replaced with standard
	X11 calls on the supplied Display.
	( Thanks mh <mh{@}pekdon{.}net> for reporting )

2003-11-09  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/WindowManager.cc (cleanup): 
	Moved XCloseDisplay to a proper place after everything has been
	cleaned up and deleted fixing pekwm crashing when shutting down /
	restarting.

	* src/PFont.cc (trim): 
	Added characther chopping when using TrimMiddle as it's needed if the
	availible width is less than what the TrimMiddle string + 2 characters
	needs.

	* src/Frame.cc (maximize): 
	Applied patch from Nathan Clegg <nathan{@}geerbox{.}com> creating
	a new action, MaxFill which acts as Maximize but considers the Frames
	around it.

2003-11-06  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/WindowManager.cc (~WindowManager): 
	Added missing call to cleanup in ~WindowManager. Closing #16

	group ( via the TRANSIENT_FOR hint ) of windows.
	( Thanks Armin <snooze{@}unixkiste{.}org> for request )

	* src/Viewport.cc (makeWOInsideVirtual, makeWOInsideReal): 
	Added two new methods beeing called from the Frame constructor
	making sure that Frames doesn't place themself outside the screen.

	* src/main.cc (main): 
	Added comments to all methods and added missing call to delete at
	the end of main.

	* src/DockApp.cc: 
	Made DockApp utilize PixmapHandler and cleaned up constructor and
	destructor.

2003-11-05  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (fillHeadInfo): 
	Fixed bug caused by checking if Xinerama was enabled causing harbour
	beeing ignored when calculating valid screen area.

	Fixed ops that caused SideMin not to work on the height. Closing #27
	( Thanks Aristotle Pagaltzis <pagaltzis at gmx dot de for reporting )

	* src/Util.hh: (isTrue):
	Now it's possible to use 1 and 0 instead of True and False.
	( Thanks pfusch for request )

	* src/WindowManager.cc (findWOAndFocus): 
	Replaced findFrameAndFocus with findWOAndFocus, findWOAndFocus uses
	the MRU list instead of stacking list which findFrameAndFocus did.

	* src/Frame.cc (fillHeadInfo): 
	Added new method now used used in fixGeometry and checkEdgeSnap to
	setup head/screen geometry removing strut and harbour areas.
	( Fixing bug causing invalid position when maximizing )

2003-10-23  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (moveToEdge): 
	Changed the behaviour of {Top,Bottom,Left,Right}Edge making them only
	modify one axis ( y for top and bottom, and x for left and right ).
	The old behaviour can be achived with
	{Top,Bottom,Left,Right}CenterEdge.
	( Thanks David Frey <dpfrey{@}shaw{.}ca> for request )

	* src/Config.cc (parseAction): 
	Removed MaximizeHorizontal and MaximizeVertical actions as Maximize
	now take two bool paremters, first one decides if horizontal should
	be toggled, second vertical.
	
	* src/Config.cc (copyConfigFiles): 
	Now bailing out if we are unable to open the source files when
	trying to copy the cfg files to ~/.pekwm
	
2003-10-10  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (growDirection): 
	Added new action GrowDirection which grows the frame in one of the
	directions ( Up, Down, Left and Right ) to the edge of the head.

2003-10-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/FrameListMenu.cc (buildName): 
	Added viewport information to the FrameList series of menus. It only
	displays if either there's more than one viewport in X or Y
	direction.
	( Thanks mh <mh{@}pekdon{.}net> for request )

	* src/Viewport.cc (moveToWO): 
	Fixed bug causing the GoTo menu go to the incorrect viewport. Also
	tweaked the behaviour so that the windowobjects viewport is
	calculated from the windowobjets center and not the top left edge.
	( Thanks Josh <joshdr77 at hotmail.com> and mh <mh{@}pekdon{.}net>
	  for reporting the issue )

2003-09-29  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* data/scripts/pekwm_themeset.pl: 
	Now sorting theme-names lexically.

	* src/Client.cc (setSkip): 
	Added _PEKWM_FRAME_SKIP hint so saving of windows skip state should
	be saved when restarting.

	* src/Client.cc (readPekwmHints): 
	Added _PEKWM_FRAME_DECOR hint so saving of windows decor state should
	be saved when restarting.

2003-09-27  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* data/scripts/pekwm_themeset.sh:
	Added shell version of the pekwm_themeset.pl dynamic contributed by
	Michal Adamec which is nice for minimal linux installations lacking
	perl.
	( Thanks Michal Adamec <emsy{@}pobox{.}sk> for script )

	* src/WindowManager.cc (focusDirectional): 
	Added new action, FocusDirectional that takes two paremeters ( only
	the first is obligatory ).

	FocusDirectional Direction Bool

	Where Direction is one of Up,Down,Left and Right and Bool decides
	wheter or not the focused window should be raised.
	

2003-09-24  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/*: 
	Replaced all the old _cfg class member variables with the use of
	Config::instance().

	* src/FrameWidget.cc (getTabWidth, getTitleWidth): 
	Applied patch fixing broken tab-width calculation when
	title-width / num-clients != integer.
	( Thanks <ghostgim{@}yahoo{.}fr> for patch )

2003-09-22  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/PFont.cc, src/PFont.hh:
	Cleaned up code minimizing code duplication.

	* src/PFont.cc, src/PFont.hh, Client.cc, Client.hh, FrameWidget.cc:
	Tuned the trimming, now only titles _not_ having any title rules
	applied get trimmed at the middle.

2003-09-21  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/PFont.cc, src/PFont.hh (trim):
	Added new option, TrimTitle which takes a string as parameter and makes
	the old obligatory ... type title shortening configurable. To achive
	the old behaviour set TrimTitle to ... in the Screen section of config.

2003-09-20  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Workspaces.cc (placeCenteredOnParent):
	Added a new placement model, CenteredOnParent that causes transient
	windows to be placed centered on their parent ( transient for ).

	* src/AutoProperties.cc, src/Client.cc, src/Frame.cc:
	Added two new options with matching autoproperties. The new options are
	PlaceNew and FocusNew and they go under the Screen section of the main
	config file. And the autoproperties have the same name and are used to
	overide the defaults.

2003-09-19  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/AutoProperties.cc (parseAutoProperty): 
	Added new autoproperty: Fullscreen.

	* src/PFont.cc, src/Theme.cc:

	( Thanks Harashino Makoto <harashi@jazz.email.ne.jp> for patch )

2003-09-17  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/BaseMenu.cc, src/WindowObject.cc:
	Moved stick to WindowObject and made Stick an valid action for menus.

	* src/Frame.cc (fullscreen): 
	Added new action Fullscreen, it's only valid from the keys file so
	you don't put yourself into trouble.
	
	* src/Frame.cc (handleClientMessage): 
	Added support for toggling _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE, _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW and
	_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN.

	* src/PFont.cc (trim, draw):
	Added a title shortening rule making too long titles skip the middle of
	the string replacing it with ...

	* src/WindowManager.cc (screenEdgeCreate):
	Fixed missing insertion of the screen edge to the workspace stacking
	list.

2003-09-16  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	Fixed broken size calculation of title fonts in menus.

2003-09-06  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	Applied patch from Etan Reisner adding more set* to the AtomUtil
	namespace.
	( Thanks Etan Reisner <deryni@eden.rutgers.edu> for patch )

2003-09-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Config.cc: 
	Enabled Mod2, Mod3 and Mod5 for actions. However, if ModX corresponds
	to a Lock key like Scroll Lock adding them won't make a difference
	to action matching.

2003-08-27  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Config.cc (parseAction): 
	Added support for {Next,Prev,Left,Right} in SendToWorkspace action.
	( Thanks Konstantin Kletschke <konsti@ludenkalle.de> for request )

	* src/ActionHandler.cc (handleAction): 
	Removed the {Next,Prev,Left,Right}Workspace actions, instead using
	GotoWorkspace {Next,Prev,Left,Right,Num}.

2003-08-26  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Config.cc: 
	Changed masks for {Next,Prev,Left,Right}Workspace to include Frames.

	* src/BaseMenu.cc (handleMotionEvent): 
	Added support for Treshold in Menu section of the mouse file.

	* src/Viewport.cc (scroll, gotoColRow): 
	Added three new actions, all of them taking two parameters:

	  ViewportGoto Col Row ( Move viewport to Col Row )
	  ViewportMoveXY X Y ( Move viewport to X Y )
	
	* src/WindowManager.cc (focusToggle): 
	Added two frequently requested actions, NextFrameMRU and
	PrevFrameMRU. Takes the same options as NextFrame and PrevFrame.

2003-08-19  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

2003-08-17  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/ActionHandler.cc (handleAction): 
	Replaced the MENU_CLOSE action with the generic ACTION_CLOSE.

2003-08-16  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/PixmapHandler.cc: 
	Added PixmapHandler class for caching Pixmap creations/frees for
	speed reasons. New option in the main config file in the Screen
	section named PixmapCacheSize determining how many unused pixmaps
	that should go into the cache is now availible.

	* src/WindowManager.cc (restart, shutdown): 
	Moved shutdown/restarting code out from WindowManager, now only
	setting _restart_command from WindowManager and restarting from main()
	
	* src/Viewport.cc (moveToWO): 
	Implemented moveToWO so that the Goto menu will work correctly if
	Frames are outside the current viewport.

2003-08-15  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/WindowObject.cc, WindowManger.cc (giveInputFocus): 
	Added focusable property to WindowObjects. And made
	WindowManager::EdgeWO unfocusable.

	* configure.in, acinclude.m4: 
	Added checks for Imlib2 ( image handling ) and Xft ( font support )
	to the configure script.
	
2003-08-11  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Client.cc (readAutoprops): 
	Fixed silly error return data instead of NULL causing transient
	windows beeing autogrouped and having the geometry set as it's done
	outside Client::readAutoprops.

	* data/themes/default/theme.in: 
	Updated the default theme so that it works together with pekwm.

	* src/Frame.cc (setupAPGeometry): 
	Replaced the Geometry auto property with two new properties,
	FrameGeometry and ClientGeometry. It's valid to use both at the
	same time but the FrameGeometry overides the ClientGeometry.

2003-08-10  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/PFont.cc: 
	Added PFontXmb type and move non-used code from PFontX11 to it. To
	use Xmb fonts append #XMB to the font name, just like one appends
	#XFT for Xft fonts.

2003-08-08  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Theme.cc (loadFont): 
	Changed the : to # used for specifying types as : conflicts with
	Xft font names.

	* src/Harbour.cc, src/Frame.cc, src/Config.cc, src/WindowManager.cc:
	Applied patch fixing Harbour+Xinerama behaviour. This also adds a
	Head keyword to the Harbour section of the config file which decides
	which head dockapps should be placed.

	( Thanks Bryan Traywick <mufasio@comcast.net> for patch )

2003-08-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Image.cc:
	Started implementing Imlib2 support, to make pekwm support more file
	formats that Xpm and have much improved image-scaling performance.

	* src/ImageHandler.cc:
	Added ImageHandler class which caches image loading to make less
	resources beeing used. ( very usefull when having multiple decors )

	* src/AutoProperties.cc (findDecorProperty): 
	Added DecorRules section to the autoproperties file. This means one
	can have different types of frame decorations based on ordinary
	property rules. Sample section:

	DecorRules {
	  Property = "^.term,^XTerm" {
	    Decor = "TERM"
	  }
	}

	Which will make terminals have the FrameDecor named TERM in the
	theme file ( if one exists ).

	* src/PFont.cc: 
	Renamed PekwmFont.* to PFont.*. Reworked font support so now there's
	a PFont baseclass, and PFontX11 PFontXft derived classes.

	Also added to the fonts system is shadowed fonts which means you can
	have two colors per font with configurable offset. A Font section in
	the theme file now looks like this:

	Font = "Vera-12#XFT" {
	  Justify = "Center"
	  Offset = "1 1"
	}

2003-08-04  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/BaseConfig.cc (parseVariables):
	Now variable expansion ends at any non alpha numeric character instead
	of only spaces and new variables as before.

	The old behaviour caused:

	$OOo = "~/OpenOffice.org1.0.3/program"
	Entry = "Writer" {Actions = "Exec $OOo/swriter &"}

	Not to work because of the variable didn't end at the / but after
	swriter.
	
	( Thanks Russell Wood <rjw@dynode.net> for reporting )

2003-08-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (close): 
	Added new action, CloseFrame which closes the Frame and all clients
	in it.
	( Thanks gim <ghostgim@yahoo.fr> for request )

2003-08-02  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Frame.cc (doGroupingDrag): 
	Added check to see if global grouping is turned off when doing
	GroupingDrag. ( Makes it ungroup wherever the window is released )

2003-08-01  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/BaseMenu.cc (setFocused): 
	Added two new colors to theme, BackgroundFocused and TextFocused, that
	is used when the menu has input focus.
	
	(handle*): 
	Now there's a Menu section of the mouse file, supported events
	currently are ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter and Leave.

	* src/AutoProperties.cc (matchAutoClass): 
	Added new method matchAutoClass now used in both
	AutoPropertis::findProperty and WindowManager::findGroup which should
	correct broken autogrouping matching rules.

2003-07-30  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/Client.cc (Client): 
	Fixed misplaced initalisation of _shaped making compilation break if
	shaping support was absent.
	( Thanks Chris Priestman <chris@rpgcron.karoo.co.uk> for reporting )

	* src/Config.cc (getMouseButton, getMod): 
	Added Any to the list of valid mouse buttons and valid modifiers,
	this should be used when configuring enter and leave events

	* src/WindowManager.cc (cleanup): 
	Now destroying the Screen Edge, might fix some shutdown issues.
	
	(RootWO)
	Added Root WindowObject so now root window actions and true focus
	follow mouse should be possible.

	* src/BaseConfig.cc (pipeFillBuffer): 
	Now doing proper saving/restoring of the SIGCHLD action.

2003-07-19  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/ActionHandler.cc (handleAction): 
	Added new action, ToggleGrouping, which toggles sets all kinds of
	grouping on/off. This I find usefull when I want to avoid
	autogrouping.

	* src/KeyGrabber.cc (load): 
	Made the "couldn't load keyfile" error more informative.
	( Thanks edgewalker for request )

2003-07-18  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

	* src/* (*): 
	Leave and Enter events are configurable, not everything is working yet

	}

	Valid position are TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Right, BottomLeft
	Bottom and BottomRight.

	}

	* src/WindowManager.cc (attachInNextPrevFrame): 
	Added four new actions:
	  AttachClientInNextFrame, AttachClientInPrevFrame,
	  AttachFrameInNexFrame and AttachFrameInPrevFrame

  * Fixed bug causing pekwm to crash if there was a unmatched pair of "" in
    the section name. Like Section = "Name {

2003-01-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc)
  * Now EdgeSnap also snaps to applications in the harbour.

2003-01-06  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(config.cc, config.hh, data/mouse)
  * Instead of using Button = "ButtonX" in the mouse config we now use
    Button = "X" instead.

(config.cc, config.hh, button.cc, button.hh, frame.cc, framewidget.cc)
  * Made it possible to use up to 7 mouse buttons for click actions, XFree86
    won't let me use it for motion events. Also made it easy to change the
    number of supported button, only need to edit config.hh.
    ( Thanks Daniel Johansson <donnex@home.se> for request )

2003-01-05  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(*)
  * We now support the --sysconfdir configure option. Default is
    PREFIX/etc/pekwm
    ( Rando Christensen updated Makefile related files )

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, atoms.cc, atoms.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Added a new hint, _PEKWM_FRAME_ID which now is used for remembering groups
    when restarting pekwm.

2003-01-04  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Changed AutoProperties behaviour, now autogrouping is based on the initial
    clients class and reloading autoprops is also based on the original
    client. ( Thanks shared for request )

(workspaces.cc, config.cc, config.hh, data/config.in)
  * Made it possible to decide which direction smart placement is placing
    windows. LeftToRight and TopToBottom. This required a config file syntax
    change so go look in data/config.in for info on howto configure it.

2003-01-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc, framewidget.cc, framewidget.hh)
  * Fixed bug in Frame::getClientFromPos and FrameWidget::draw causing the
    title clicks activated wrong client when alot of clients were grouped.
    ( Thanks shared for reporting ) 

2003-01-01  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

    ( Thanks Daniel Johansson <donnex@home.se> for reporting )

2002-12-30  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh)
  * Cleaned up unused or unneeded variables.

(config.cc, config.hh, workspaces.cc)
  * Removed the config option ReportOnlyFrames and made it the default
    behaviour.

2002-12-29  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(data/keys, data/menu, data/autoprops)
  * Uppdated the default config files to use the new more compact syntax.

(*)
  * Big code restructuring, splitting Frame into Frame and Framewidget also
    slimming down the Client class. Not yet 100% done but it changes the
    behaviour of things and tries to be alot more Frame centric than Client
    centric.

(autoprops.cc)
  * Changed the Class keyword to Name in the autoprops config file, which
    makes it possible to use the new syntax Property = "xterm,XTerm" {

2002-12-25  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(screeninfo.cc, screeninfo.hh, windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh)

    ( Thanks Alaa Abd El Fatah <alaa@linux-egypt.org> for the work )

2002-12-11  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(actionhandler.cc, gotomenu.*, windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh)
  * Added a new action, ShowGotoMenu which pops up a menu with a list of
    all active clients on all workspaces. Lets you click one and then it
    goes to that workspace, raises the client and gives it focus.

(frame.cc)
  * Changed grouping behavior, it's now possible to group a allready grouped
    client withouth having to ungroup it first.

(baseconfig.cc, baseconfig.hh)
  * New parsing code, handles multiple sections per line and supports the
    INCLUDE keyword that makes it possible to include external files to
    be included.
    ( Thanks Alaa Abd El Fatah <alaa@linux-egypt.org> for the work )

2002-12-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

  * Various cleaning.

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Reworked FocusNextFrame action and added FocusPrevFrame while working
    on it. Also, added a new config option to the Screen section.

      ShowFrameList = "Bool"

    Which decides wheter or not to show a list of clients when doing
    Focus{Next/Prev}Frame.

2002-12-06  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Reworked focus code a bit and removed the old config models and replaced
    them with a new config section.

	Focus { Enter = "Bool"; Leave = "Bool"; Click = "Bool; New = "Bool" }

2002-12-04  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(baseconfig.cc)
  * Extended the parsing code so it now supports a more condensed format:

      Section { Param = "Value"; Param = "Value" }

(*)
  * Cleaning

2002-12-01  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

  * Reworked inserting and removing of Clients. Clients becomes inserted after
    the current one and when a client becomes removed the client left of it
    becomes focused.

(windowmanager.cc)
  * Rewrote focusNextFrame so that it hopefully fixes the gcc-2.96 crash.

2002-11-29  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

    ( Thanks shared for reporting )

2002-11-28  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, actionhandler.cc, pekwm.hh, config.cc)
  * Added new mousebutton action, ActivateOrRaise which if the client
    isn't allready focused, gives it focus, and if it's focused raises it.

(frame.cc, frame.hh, actionhandler.cc)
  * Resizing no longer Warps the pointer and lets the user resize in all
    directions when using ClientMotion resizing.

(*)
  * Added new action, RaiseAndActivate which is Raise and ActivateClient
    combined into one action.
    ( Thanks shared for reporting )
  * Cleaned up and reworked the Action system.

    are now replaced with:
    
    ApplyOn = "Start Transient"

    Also, WorkspaceChange has been renamed to Worksapce and a New keywoard
    has been introduced. Start now means the start of pekwm and new means the
    mapping of a new client.

(client.cc)
  * Remove m_has_strut and added operator=(const CARD32*) for class Strut.

(client.cc, client.hh, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Removed Client::construcClient and moved it to the constuctor and while
    I were at it made it possible to have 3 placement models.

pekwm-0.1.2 released

(*)
  * A _basic_ manual page and docs now reside in the docs dir.
    ( Thanks Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> for this work )

2002-11-18  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(config.cc, config.hh)
  * Moved the mouseconfig out from config to a separate file called mouse.

(theme.cc, basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed issue with text in the status window not beeing visible if
    pekwm was compiled withouth menu support.

(font.cc)
  * Fixed a typo making colors on Xft fonts behave weird.
    ( Thanks Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> for reporting )

2002-11-14  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(harbour.cc, harbour.hh, config.cc, config.hh, pekwm.hh)
  * Added Placement and Orientation support for the harbour.
    Options:     
      Placement = "Top | Bottom | Left | Right"
      Orientation = "TopToBottom | BottomToTop | LeftToRight | RightToLeft"
    This relods when reloading the config, also the stacking is uppdated.
	
(frame.cc)  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
  * Fixed a bug causing Client actions with modifiers be executed twice.
    ( Thanks shared for reporting. )

2002-11-13  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc)
  * Reverted the look of the WireFrame to only a rectangle to fix issues
    when moving/resizing borderless windows.
    ( Thanks Jeremy Naylor <jnaylor@cisco.com> for reporting )

2002-11-12  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(harbour.cc, harbuor.hh, workspaces.cc)
  * Reworked the stacking of the harbour so that it shouldn't flicker anymore.
    Still, changed harbour stacking from Above to Below requries a restart for
    changes to take full effect.

  * Cleanups.

2002-11-02  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(client.cc, client.hh, actionhandler.cc, config.cc, pekwm.hh)
  * We now have both a Close and a Kill action, the close one sends an
    WM_DELETE message if the client supports it, and the kill one kills
    it with XKillClient.

(config.cc, keys.cc)
  * Changed the behaviour of mods on keygrabs and button actions, if you don't
    use the Mod keywoard it'll grab withouth any modifier making the None
    modifier keyword obsolete.

(*)
  Config file parsing is rewritten, this included the most of Config and Theme
  to be rewritten too. The new base syntax is:

    Section {
      Name = "Value"
    }

  Which hopefully is alot easier to read.
  This also causes all configuration files _and_ themes not to work as they
  need to be rewritten to the new format.

2002-10-30  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Added two new options:
	WorkspaceWarpResistance* unsigned int;
	WrapWorkspaceWarp* bool;

2002-10-29  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc)
  * Reworked moving of windows so that you'll now get the status window
    even if you move in Opaque mode.

(config.cc, config.hh, frame.cc)
  * Added new option, OpaqueResize which will if it's set to true resize
    while showing it's content. Also, WireMove was removed and replaced
    with OpaqueMove, which is the same option but inverted.

(keys.cc, config.cc, pekwm.hh, actionhandler.cc, frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Added new keybinding, MoveToCorner which takes one parameter, which can
    be one of the following:
	TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft or BottomRight
    which moves the active window to that corner of the screen.
	
(util.cc)
  * Added function trimLeadingBlanks for use in parsing code.

2002-10-27  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(baseconfig.cc, baseconfig.hh, config.cc, rootmenu.cc, keys.cc, autoprops.cc)

2002-10-24  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(workspaces.cc, workspaces.hh, frame.cc, config.cc, config.hh)
  * Implemented Frame-to-Frame snapping and therefore added a new configuration
    option, FrameSnap which is amount of pixels between two frames before it
    snaps. If it's 0 no snapping occurs.

    NOTE: EdgeSnapWidth config option is replaced with the EdgeSnap config
    option which no longer is a bool, it's now a unsigned int.

(client.cc, client.hh, config.cc, actionhandler.cc, pekwm.hh)
  * Added three new key grabber commands:
      ToggleBorder, ToggleTitlebar and ToggleDecor

2002-10-23  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(image.cc)

2002-10-20  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(*)
  * Basic DockApp support via the harbour, still it is in early stage
    of development. Enable via compile time option --enable-harbour

(basemenu.cc, basemenu.hh, windowmanager.cc)
  * Altered the behaviour of menus, items are now selected if you enter a
    submenu. Also, the selected item has two lines on it, and it's possible
    to give the menus name with the MenuName keyword.

2002-10-19  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(genericmenu.hh)
  * Fixed missing include guard in genericmenu.hh

(client.cc)
  * If a transient window unmaps, we only give the parent focus if the
    transient window was focused.

(client.cc)
  * Fixed small issue in handleMapRequest, we didn't look wheter or not we
    were on the active workspace, causing mozilla to map where it
    shouldn't.

2002-10-17  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc, frame.hh, workspaces.cc, windowmanager.cc)
  * Reworked hiding and unhiding of clients/frame as
    Rando Christensen <rando@babblica.net> reported that the
    switch-workspace-to-fast still existed but were really hard to replicate.

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, workspaces.hh)
  * Added method findClientToFocus in WindowManager which tries to find a
    client that can be focused. Also, using this the last focused client
    is remembered when you kill a client or whatever.

(button.cc, button.hh, frame.cc, theme.cc)
  * Fixed a bug causing pekwm to segfault if you used button 4 or 5 ( usually
    the scroll wheel ) on the titlebar buttons. Also, while I were at it
    I added support for configuring all 5 buttons for each button.
    ( Thanks Holger Schibalsky <schibalsky@web.de> )

2002-10-16  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc)
  * Fixed issue with the right border becoming covered with the non active
    clients in a frame.
    ( Jonas Lundqvist <jonaslundqvist@gmx.net> for reporting )

(client.cc, frame.cc, workspaces.cc)
  * Fixed some Xinerama compile issues.
    ( Thanks Matt Keadle <mkeadle@gentoo.org> for reporting )

2002-10-13  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, frame.cc)
  * Altered behaviour of resize, first we now have different cursors
    indicating what direction is going to be resized also resize will start
    as soon as Button1 is pressed. ( Thanks agnitio for request )

2002-10-12  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(screeninfo.cc, screeninfo.hh, keys.cc, keys.hh, client.cc, frame.cc)
  * Started to use XGetModifierMapping ( after a peak in WindowMaker's
    source ) to figure out wich modifier Num and Scroll lock has.

(image.cc)
  * Fixed issue in unload, as I weren't resetting the size of the image holders
    loading from a theme with border at the top one without caused troubles.

2002-10-11  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc)
  * Reworked unmap handling, now we "filter" the unmap events we cause
    and then we can listen on the "real" events, wich hopefully resolvs
    the unmap issues of pekwm. Also, this rework seemed to resolv the
    to fast Workspace switching bug.

(workspaces.cc)
  * Added check to make sure that the last focused client aren't hidden
    before activating it.

2002-10-10  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(basemenu.cc)
  * Fixed XErrors related to trying to set menu height to 0.

(keys.cc, theme.cc, client.cc, frame.cc)
  * Fixed some compile warnings uncovered with -Wall.

(theme.cc)
  * Fixed unmatched pair of XGrabServer / XUngrabServer causing pekwm not to
    start if there weren't any clients on the screen and menu support weren't
    compiled in.

(*)
  * Renamed the USE_XFT and USE_MENUS defines to XFT and MENUS.

2002-10-09  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>

    set.

2002-10-08  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc, frame.hh)
  * Now I keep track of the current title pixmaps dimension and reuse the
    Pixmap if it has good dimensions.

(*)
  * Uppdated the default theme, removed the what-took-so-long theme.

(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, frame.cc, client.cc, client.hh)
  * Not using XSetInputFocus all over the place anymore, using
    WindowManager::focusClient which now takes care of that part.
    Also removed WindowManager::unfocusAllClients as it wasn't used
    anymore.

(frame.cc)
  * When resizing with the keygrabber, we now make sure that the window isn't
    shaded.

2002-10-07  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, client.cc)
  * Reordered the removeFromClientList in the Client destructor, also
    making sure that the m_focused_client get set to NULL in
    WindowManger::removeClient if it's beeing removed.

(client.cc, client.hh, frame.cc)
  * Renamed sendConfig to sendConfigureRequest and removed all the calls
    from Frame and moved them into the appropiate places in Client.

2002-10-06  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc)
  * Reworked handleEnterNotify a bit, wich now is a bit smarter.

(frame.cc, client.cc)
  * Fixed WIN_LAYER < WIN_LAYER_NORMAL stacking issue.

    (Thanks digiwano for reporting)

2002-10-04  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(workspaces.cc, workspaces.hh, config.cc, config.hh, windowmanager.cc)
  * Added new configure option, ReportOnlyFrames wich will make pekwm
    only report the active clients in the frames.

2002-10-03  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(client.cc)
  * Not caring about struts in handleConfigureRequest anymore, resolves the
    issue with mplayer not beeing able to set itself to fullscreen mode
    because of it beeing resized because of struts.

2002-10-02  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, windowmanager.hh, client.cc, keys.cc, keys.hh)
  * Added new compile time option, --enable/disable-keygrabber wich
    decides wheter or not keygrabber should be enabled. It defaults
    to true. ( Thanks ? for request )
    This speeded things up alot, what's up with keygrabbing taking so
    much time? Needs investigation.

(client.cc, windowmanager.cc)
  * Started to listen on _NET_WM_DESKTOP so that you can move clients
    between workspaces with gnome-panel etc. Also cleaned a little.

(config.cc, config.hh, client.cc, client.hh)
  * Made window placement configurable. Syntax is:

      PlacementModel* Placement FallBackPlacement;

    The possible placement modes are: Smart, MouseCentered and MouseTopLeft.
    ( Thanks Dirk Busse <a0104237@addcom.de> for request )

2002-09-26  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(autoprops.cc)
  * Changed the Workspace entry in the autoprops file, now workspace
    counting starts from 1 and not 0. 

(windowmanager.cc)
  * Trimmed off LeaveWindowMask and ButtonMotionMask from the rootwindow
    listening, as we shouldn't need them.

2002-09-25  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(windowmanager.cc, workspaces.cc, workspaces.hh)
  * When changing between workspaces the focused client is remembered.
    If it has been destroyed, the ontop window will become focused.

(windowmanager.cc, client.cc)
  * Cleaned up focusing a bit more, no flickering when changing workspace
    and less work by pekwm required. 

2002-09-24  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc)
  * Fixed the separator / title justification issue when drawing the titlebar,
    thanks Steve Jacobs <steve@trinidadusa.net> for reminding.

(image.cc, image.hh, theme.cc, theme.hh, frame.cc)
  * Removed the Xpm class and replaced it with the Image class, they're
    pretty much the same class but Image is supposedly a bit speedier.

2002-09-20  Claes Nasten  <pekdon{@}pekdon{.}net>
(frame.cc, client.cc, keys.cc, pekwm.hh)

    and selected(not yet done)) , also the button box isn't there anymore. It's
    been obsoleted by configurable buttons who also are pixmap themeable.
    Button config syntax goes like this:

    win.button* ActionB1 ActionB2 ActionB3 :FocusedXPM UnfocusedXPM PressedXPM;

    And possible actions are (Maximize, MaximizeVertical, MaximizeHorizontal,
    Resize, Shade, Iconify, Stick, AlwaysOnTop, Close,
    NextInGroup, PrevInGroup and NoAction)

(frame.cc,frame.hh,keys.cc)
  * Now MaximizeVertical and MaximizeHorizontal actually works.

(keys.cc, keys.hh)
	* Parsing seems to work fine now, cfg file syntax is:
		Action* Mods Mods Key : Parameter;	
	* Added more keybindings: NudgeHorizontal(int inc), NudgeVertical(int inc),
		NextInGroup, PrevInGroup and Stick.
	* As I added Stick I fixed so that clients in a sticky group(groups becomes
		if any client in it is sticky) are ungrouped they ungroup on the current
		desktop.
