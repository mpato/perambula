The Pekwm Window Manager is written by Claes Nästén. The code is based
on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no
longer resembles aewm++ at all. It also has an expanded feature-set,
including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), auto
properties, xinerama and keygrabber that supports keychains, and much
more.
