<simplesect id="config-menu-custommenus" xreflabel="Custom Menus">
  <title>Custom Menus</title>

  <para>
    User can also define an unlimited amount of custom menus.
    They are called with the ShowMenu action much like the Root and Window
    menus are (see <xref linkend="config-keys_mouse-actions"/>).
  </para>

  <para>
    In the example menu on this documentation, we created your own
    menu, called 'MyOwnMenuName'. Basically, outside of the RootMenu
    and WindowMenu sections, we open our own section called
    'MyOwnMenuName'.  This can of course be called whatever you want
    it to be called, but do note that the menu names are case
    insensitive. This means you can't have one menu called
    'MyMostUsedApps' and one called 'mymostusedapps'.
  </para>

  <para>
    Lets see that example again, simplified:
  </para>

  <screen>RootMenu = "Pekwm" { ... }
WindowMenu = "Window Menu" { ... }
MyOwnMenuName = "Most used apps" {
	Entry = "Term" { Actions = "Exec $TERM &" }
	Entry = "XCalc" { Actions = "Exec xcalc &" }
	Entry = "Dillo" { Actions = "Exec dillo &" }
}</screen>

  <para>
    We would call this new menu using the action 'ShowMenu
    MyOwnMenuName', The menu would show 'Most used apps' as the menu
    title and list 'Term', 'XCalc' and 'Dillo' in the menu ready to be
    executed.
  </para>
