  <title>The pekwm start file</title>

  <para>
    The <filename>~/.pekwm/start</filename> file is the simplest of
    all of pekwm's config files. It's a simple shell script that's run
    on pekwm startup. Therefore, to run, it needs to be set executable
    with

    <command>chmod +x ~/.pekwm/start</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Why anyone would use <filename>start</filename> rather than just use their 
    <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename> file? Well, the answer is, the
    start file is executed during the pekwm initialization phase -
    therefore, it gets re-executed when you issue a pekwm 'restart'.
  </para>

  <para>
    Here's an example pekwm <filename>start</filename> file. Be
    careful to place long running applications to the background, or
    you will seem stuck when trying to start pekwm.

    <screen>#!/bin/sh

xmessage 'hi. pekwm started.' &
some_command &</screen>
