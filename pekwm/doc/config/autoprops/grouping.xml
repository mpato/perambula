  <para>
    The last thing to know is autogrouping. Autogrouping is actually
    very simple, although it might be a bit confusing at first.  Group
    is an identifier, it's just a string, (in my example, we'll call
    it netwin).  Size tells how many clients to group together in one
    frame.
  </para>

  <para>
    The example: We want to autogroup Sylpheed and Opera together,
    allowing as many instances of the program windows to be grouped as
    there are.  Here's the Autoprops section for that:
  </para>

  <screen>Property = ".*,^opera" {
	Group = "netwin" {
		Size = "0"
	}
	ApplyOn = "New Start Reload"
}
Property = ".*,^Sylpheed" {
	Group = "netwin" {
		Size = "0"
	}
	ApplyOn = "New Start Reload Transient"
}</screen>

  <para>
    This creates two rules: "For any window matching '.*,^opera',
    group these in the 'netwin' group. Apply this on pekwm
    start/reload and when new windows matching this property are
    opened, but do not include dialog windows", and "For any window
    matching '.*,^Sylpheed', group in the 'netwin' group. Apply on
    pekwm start/reload and when new windows matching this property are
    opened, also include possible dialog windows to the group. Open
    the window to the group but do not bring it upmost
    automatically".
  </para>

  <para>
    To group unlimited windows together, use size 0.
  </para>

  <para>
    Also note that you can have as many Group identifiers as you
    want. Autogrouping is a very flexible system. Try playing around
    with it.
