    "Autoproperties" is short for "Automatic Properties". This is
    pekwm's way of setting certain things up for applications based on
    the window's internal id.  You can set up a lot of things, such as
    size, iconified state, start location, grouped state
    (automatically having one window group to another), workspace to
    start on, whether it has a border or titlebar, and more. It is
    also possible to automatically modify window titles and to decide
    the order of applications on the harbour with
    autoproperties.
