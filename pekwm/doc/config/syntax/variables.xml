<title>Variables In Pekwm Config Files</title>
<para>
Pekwm config enables you to use both internal to pekwm variables, as
well as global system variables. Internal variables are prefixed with
a <command>$</command>, global variables with <command>$_</command>.
</para>
<screen># examples of how to set both type of variables
$INTERNAL = "this is an internal variable"
$_GLOBAL = "this is a global variable"

# examples of how to read both type of variables
RootMenu = "Menu" {
	Entry = "$_GLOBAL" { Actions = "xmessage $INTERNAL" }
}
</screen>
<para>
There is one special global variable pekwm handles. It is called
$_PEKWM_CONFIG_FILE. This global variable is read when pekwm starts, and
it's contents will be used as the default config file. It will also be
updated to point to the currently active config file if needed.
</para>
<para>
Variables can probably be defined almost anywhere, but it's probably a better
idea to place them at the top of the file, outside of any sections.
