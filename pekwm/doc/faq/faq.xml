      If you can't find the answer to your question here, read the
      whole thing again. Chances are you just missed it the first time
      around. If you still can't find it, and you have gone through the
      documentation, tried until your fingers bleed from typing, and
      started a hunger strike against evil documentation projects that
      contain no helpful advices for you, then you may ask your
      question in IRC or on the mailing list.
