<title>How window grouping works</title>
<para>The first thing to know is how to group one window to another. 
Middle-Click (On a normal X setup, the 2nd mouse button is the middle button)
the titlebar of the first window and begin to drag the window. You should now 
see a rectangle with the window's title in it. Drag that rectangle to above the
target window, and release your mouse button.</para>

<note><para>Any time this document mentions a key or mouse button, there's a strong 
likelihood that you can change which key or mouse button is used for that 
function. Please see the <xref linkend="config-keys_mouse"/> section.</para></note>
<para>Now that you have windows in a group, you need to learn to choose 
between windows in that group. The first way is by clicking the middle
mouse button on the window's part of the titlebar. That window should 
now be the currently-active window of the group. You can also use a 
keybinding for this. The default keybindings are Mod4+Tab and Mod4+Shift+Tab
to go forward and back between active window in the frame.</para>
<para>To de-group, simply middle click and drag the window off the frame,
	and release anywhere. If you release over another window group, you'll 
	move the window to the new group. Default keybinding for detaching
	clients from a group is first Ctrl+Mod1+T then D.</para>
<para>You can also set windows up to automatically be grouped to one another.
	See the <xref linkend="config-autoprops"/> section for more details.</para>
