<title>What is window grouping?</title>
<para>Window grouping is a very simple concept, but it could be hard to 
understand at first. It's a simple way of making multiple applications
share the exact same space.</para>
<para>The simplest way to explain this is with an analogy. Imagine you have
20 sheets of paper. To save space, you stack them on top of each other. then, 
you have little tabs sticking out of one edge so you can quickly flip to 
any sheet of paper.</para>
<para>You have likely stumbled upon a WWW-browser that calls this
tabbing. In pekwm, Window grouping is visually done by dividing up the physical
space of the titlebar. We don't call them tabs for historical reasons,
but refer to them as "clients". Windows that can contain any number of clients
are more than often referred as "frames".</para>
<para>Also note that a frame can contain any type of clients. If you
want to group one of your WWW-browser windows with your text editor for
future reference, you're free to do so.</para>
