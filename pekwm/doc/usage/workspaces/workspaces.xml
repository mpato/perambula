<title>Workspaces</title>
<para>Workspaces in pekwm are a very common feature, found in almost every 
	UNIX window manager in existence. They're also called desktops in some
	window managers. In Pekwm-Speak, "workspace", "desktop", and "desk" are 
	interchangeable. Use whichever one you feel like using.</para>
<note><para>By default, pekwm enables four workspaces. You can change this by 
editing your <filename>~/.pekwm/config</filename> file. See
<xref linkend="config-configfile"/> section for more details.
