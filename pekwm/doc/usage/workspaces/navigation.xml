<para>
You can send windows to another workspace by right-clicking the titlebar, going to
'send to' and picking the desktop you'd like. Another option is using the SendToWorkspace
keybindings (by default, Mod4 and one of F1, F2, F3, or F4). Using the mouse to drag a
window over the right or left screen edge makes it move to the next or previous workspace.
Also try placing the mouse pointer on a client window and rotating the mouse wheel while
holding Mod1 down to send a window to the next or previous workspace and follow it there yourself.

<para>
Switch desktops by using the GoToWorkspace keybindings (by default Mod4 and one of 1,2,3, or 4),
or the "GotoWorkspace Next" and "GotoWorkspace Prev" actions (by default Ctrl+Mod1+Right and Ctrl+Mod1+Left).
Holding Mod1 key while moving the mouse pointer over the right or left screen edge will make you move to the
next or previous workspace. Also pressing the left mouse button on the right or left screen edge
will make you move to the next or previous workspace. Using the mouse wheel on the background or
the screen edges also changes your workspace.
