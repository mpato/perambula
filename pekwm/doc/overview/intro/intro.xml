<title>An Introduction to Pekwm</title>

<para>The Pekwm Window Manager is written by &program-author;. The code is
based on the aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that 
it no longer resembles aewm++ at all. It also has an expanded feature-set,
including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), auto properties, 
xinerama and keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.</para>
