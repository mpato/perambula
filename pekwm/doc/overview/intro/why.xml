<title>Why Pekwm?</title>
<para>"Why make another window manager?", some ask. This may confuse some
people, but the best answer is "Why not?". There are arguments out there
that it's better to have a single standard desktop environment, so that
our mothers can find their way around, but in all honestly, if most of us
wanted the same environment as our mothers, we probably wouldn't be reading
this anyway. The same can also be applied to Your sister, your roommate,
your wife, even your cat.</para>

<!-- If that's not reason enough for you, Here's the 
official reason given by the Pekwm author, &program-author;:</para>


<para><quote>Well, there are tons of window managers out there. Maybe just becase 
there aren't any good ones or because of the more likely fact that a 
windowmanager is a very personal thing.  Anyway, why pekwm came around 
isn't really because I were lacking a good window manager, no it was 
because I were lacking an internet connection making it hard to 
follow the <ulink url="http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net">fluxbox</ulink>
development.  Therefore I started to play around with 
<ulink url="http://saphire.sourceforge.net">aewm++</ulink>, 
just for fun at home. You might wonder why I don't help contributing 
to it instead of making my own window manager, well, I've talked with the 
developer and we had different ideas and he thinks just as me, window 
managers are personal and therefore he wants to do what he wants with 
aewm++ and not what we want. (hopefully I've gotten this right :/)</quote></para>

<para>"Why should I use pekwm?", others ask. Nobody ever said you should.
However, we use it. And you're welcome to as well. You should use the 
environment most suited to you. For a better answer to this question,
