<title>Unpacking the Archive</title>
<para>The first step to compiling pekwm is to unpack the archive.
Unpacking it depends on which version you downloaded:
</para>

<screen>tar -zxvf pekwm-&current-version;.tar.gz
tar -jxvf pekwm-&current-version;.tar.bz2</screen>
<note><!-- don't like title <title>If -j doesn't work</title> -->
<para>The '-j' option works normally on most linux systems, and as of the 
current GNU tar development version, is part of GNU tar. If your system does
not support the -j option, you can use two things: 
<command>bzip2 -dc pekwm-&current-version;.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -</command>
or <command>bzip2 -d pekwm-&current-version;.tar.bz2</command> followed by
<command>tar -xvf pekwm-&current-version;.tar</command>. This also works for
the .tar.gz version using <command>gzip -dc</command> 
or <command>gzip -d</command>.</para></note>

<para>The 'v' options are optional, they show you the filenames as they're 
being extracted. at this point, you should have a pekwm-&current-version; 
directory. Use <command>cd pekwm-&current-version;</command> to get there.</para>
